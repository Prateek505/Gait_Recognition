# Gait-Based Vision System for Autonomous Following Cart

A vision-based system that identifies and follows a specific person by recognizing their unique walking pattern (gait signature).

## Features
- Gait detection via video keypoint extraction
- Person identification from movement signature
- Automated cart following logic (simulation/model stage)

## Technologies
Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Status
⏳ Project bootstrapped — development ongoing.
